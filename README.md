# lstm-bitcoin-trading

It's a combination of RNN (LSTM) and a trading bot which takes decision based on predicted prices. 

It follows logical approach to solve the problem "when to buy" and "when to sell". 

I developed this referring from various sources including books, blogs etc. Constructive feedback is welcome. Feel free to suggest improvement in code. 

If you have found a better combinatorial solution (ML + Trading Bot), share the code please.
